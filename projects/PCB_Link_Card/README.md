PCB Link Card: A personal business card on a PCB!
This business card was a culmination of hours of struggle. It has a simple NFC chip inside, that I'll probably link to one of my social medias, as well as a cool design on the front and back.

Plan:\n
The subtotal is $68.34 CAD.

Design:\n
I first started with a simple NFC chip-type business card, made by following a tutorial, then branched out for the design of both the front and back sides. It was pretty hard to sort out the wiring, and make sure it wouldn't cross and short circuit. Though it doesn't look very complex, I'm pretty proud of it, seeing as i've never designed a PCB board before :D
